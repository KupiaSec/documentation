# Execution

Welcome to the operational heart of KupiaSec, where our structure and execution processes are designed to ensure efficiency, transparency, and the highest quality in smart contract audits.

### Organization Structure

#### 1. Operation Team

Our Operation Team comprises dedicated professionals in managerial roles, sales and developer relations, and skilled developers. This team works cohesively to facilitate the smooth execution of audits and ensure effective communication with clients and partners.

#### 2. Auditors

The backbone of KupiaSec, our auditors, play a pivotal role in conducting security reviews. As part-owners of the organization, auditors have a direct stake in its success, with shares in the treasury reflecting their contributions.

### How We Execute

#### 1. Private Audit

* We execute the modified [MPA](https://mpa.solodit.xyz/) model, a comprehensive approach that includes a Solo Audit, an Internal Competition, and a Mitigation Review.
* The lead auditor for a Private Audit is nominated based on their score and availability, ensuring that the most qualified individual leads the process.
* The quote for a private audit is made public, promoting transparency, and competitiveness in securing orders.

#### 2. Audit Competition

* Auditors are highly encouraged to participate in renowned competitions such as Code4rena, Sherlock, Cantina, and CodeHawks.
* Scores are assigned based on earnings and ranking, influencing future opportunities.

#### 3. Bug Bounty

* KupiaSec establishes a shared team account on major bug bounty platforms.
* Auditors are incentivized to submit findings, increasing team visibility. Importantly, 100% of the reward goes directly to the individual auditor. The team is ready to assist in mediation if necessary.

#### 4. CTF Challenge

* KupiaSec actively participates in major Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, focusing on enhancing the organization's reputation.
* While CTF challenges may not bring direct revenue, ranking high contributes significantly to elevating KupiaSec's standing in the security community.

Our execution processes are designed to not only ensure the highest quality in our audits but also to empower and reward our auditors. Join KupiaSec and be part of a collaborative community that values transparency, fairness, and continuous improvement in smart contract security.
