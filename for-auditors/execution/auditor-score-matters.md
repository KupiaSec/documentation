# Auditor Score Matters

At KupiaSec, we recognize that the auditor score is not just a number; it is a critical factor that significantly influences the dynamics of our organization. Here's why the auditor score matters:

### 1. Lead Auditor Nominations for MPA

#### 1.1 Private Audit Excellence

In the realm of Private Audits, the lead auditor, responsible for orchestrating the audit process, is nominated based on their score and availability. The auditor with the highest score often claims the majority of the total budget allocated for the audit. This ensures that the lead auditor is not only qualified but has demonstrated exceptional expertise, contributing to the overall success of the Private Audit.

### 2. Exclusive Opportunities on Competition Platforms

#### 2.1 Unique Opportunities as Private Audits

In scenarios where exclusive opportunities arise on competition platforms—such as leading a competition on Sherlock or participating in an invitational contest on C4—KupiaSec employs a unique approach. These opportunities are treated as Private Audits via a two-phase MPA model.

#### 2.2 Top Auditor Privilege

The chance to lead such exclusive opportunities is reserved for the top auditor based on their score and availability. This ensures that KupiaSec leverages the expertise of its most accomplished auditors in seizing unique opportunities, further enhancing the organization's reputation and influence in the security community.

### 3. Score and Availability as Key Criteria

The auditor score, coupled with availability, serves as a dual criterion for important roles within KupiaSec. This strategic approach not only rewards auditors based on merit but also ensures that the organization maximizes the potential of its top talents in various high-impact scenarios.

Join KupiaSec, where your auditor score is not just a metric but a gateway to exciting opportunities and impactful leadership roles within the organization. Your expertise and dedication directly shape the future of smart contract security at KupiaSec.
