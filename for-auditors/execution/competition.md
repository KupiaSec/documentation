# Competition

Auditors at KupiaSec are not just encouraged but highly motivated to participate in all public competitions. This dynamic engagement in the competitive landscape is a cornerstone of our collaborative approach to smart contract security.

### General Rules

1. **Team Functionality:** We do not use the team functionality supported by the platforms, eliminating the need to bind personal accounts to the team account.
2. **Pioneer Nomination:** For competitions with more than one auditor participating, a **pioneer** is nominated. The pioneer is responsible for explaining the codebase at the 1/3 point in the competition period.
3. **Submission Procedure:** Auditors submit their findings at least 2 hours before the end of the competition, but not on the competition platform. Submissions are made on the Kupia website.
4. **Submission Policy:** All submissions are handled by a designated **submitter** nominated by the management team. Submissions must be done in the presence of at least two auditors to ensure transparency. The submitter can revise the report for better quality, merge duplicates, and must notify all auditors about the submission status.
5. **Reward Distribution:** For general competitions, all rewards go to auditors 100%, and duplicates are handled in 1/N.
6. **Auditor Scores Update:** Scores are updated based on earnings and ranking with different weights according to the platform, encouraging participation in specific platforms.

| Platform  | Formula (E - earning, R - rank) |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| Code4rena | E / R \* 2                      |
| Sherlock  | E / R \* 3                      |
| Others    | E / R                           |

#### Submission Policy

We highly respect everyoneâ€™s time for public competitions, and findings are not shared across the team.

1. All submission is handled by a **submitter**, a nominated auditor by the management team.
2. Submission MUST be handled in the presence of at least two auditors to guarantee transparency.
3. The submitter CAN revise the report for a better quality.
4. For duplicates, the submitter MUST merge them into one.
5. The submitter MUST notify all auditors about the submission status so that individual auditors can submit from their account if necessary.

### Privileged Opportunities

One of the driving forces for our collaborative efforts is the pursuit of privileged opportunities. Winning these opportunities not only enhances our collective reputation but also brings credit to every team member.

**The organization fee applies to the Total Rewards for these privileged opportunities. We apply bump factors in the score calculation for some privileged opportunities to encourage participation.**

Note that the **total score** is used to select the lead auditor, and the total reward is the client budget.
