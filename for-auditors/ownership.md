# Ownership

At KupiaSec, ownership isn't just a concept; it's a fundamental principle that aligns everyone's vision and fosters a sense of community. Here's a detailed look at how ownership is structured within our organization:

### Vision Alignment through Ownership

We believe that true alignment of vision is only achievable when everyone is exposed to the organization's revenue. This shared ownership model ensures that each member, from auditors to the operation team, has a direct stake in KupiaSec's success.

### DAO-Like Operation

While we may not currently integrate explicit web3 functionality, our operational model operates with the spirit of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This approach lays the foundation for a collaborative and inclusive environment.

### Total Shares and Claiming from the Treasury

The total shares of KupiaSec are fixed at 10,000, representing the collective ownership of the organization. Anyone with a share has the right to claim their portion from the treasury.

### Share Distribution

* **Operation Team Shares:** 5,000 shares are initially reserved for the operation team. These may be redistributed among Managers, Sales, DevRel, and Developers based on the evolving needs of the organization.
* **Auditor Shares:** The remaining 5,000 shares are allocated to auditors. Each individual auditor's share is determined by their score in the last recorded 90 days. For instance, if auditors A, B, and C have scores of 100, 150, and 250 respectively, A would have 1,000 shares, B with 1,500 shares, and C with 2,500 shares.

### Treasury Reset and Reward Tracking

Whenever there is a change in shares or rewards, a treasury reset occurs. This process ensures transparency and accountability as all rewards are meticulously tracked for each shareholder.

### Future Direction Impact

Share ownership is not just a passive stake; it actively influences the future direction of KupiaSec. Decisions regarding the organization's trajectory are made collectively, with each shareholder having a say in shaping the path forward.
