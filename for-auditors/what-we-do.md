# What We Do

Welcome to KupiaSec, where auditors play a crucial role in securing smart contracts. Here, we conduct thorough security reviews in all phases, encompassing pre-deployment and post-deployment scenarios. Let's delve into the specifics of our audit services and the collaborative approach that sets us apart.

### 1. Private Audit

Our Private Audit is a meticulous examination of smart contracts using our modified Multi-Phase Audit (MPA) model. This includes a Solo Audit by a lead auditor, an internal competition among all auditors, and a mitigation review to address identified vulnerabilities. This process ensures the highest quality and effectiveness in securing smart contracts.

### 2. Public Audit

#### 2.1. Audit Competition

We actively participate in renowned competitions such as Code4rena, Sherlock, Cantina, and CodeHawks. Individual auditors are strongly encouraged to engage, earning scores based on their contributions. These scores not only influence future opportunities but also determine shares of the treasury, fostering a meritocratic environment.

#### 2.2. Bug Bounty

KupiaSec maintains a shared team account on major bug bounty platforms. Auditors are encouraged to submit findings, increasing the team's visibility and credibility. The rewards from bug bounty programs are 100% directed to the individual auditor who discovered the vulnerabilities, with the team available for mediation if needed.

#### 2.3. CTF Challenges

Participation in major Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges enhances our organization's reputation. While CTF challenges may not bring direct revenue, achieving top rankings contributes significantly to KupiaSec's standing in the security community.
