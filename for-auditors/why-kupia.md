# Why Kupia

At KupiaSec, we recognize that auditors are the backbone of our organization. We are not just an audit firm; we are a community of skilled professionals who take pride in contributing to the security of smart contracts. Here's why Kupia is the best place for auditors:

### 1. **Meritocratic Opportunities**

At KupiaSec, we believe in recognizing and rewarding talent. Our meritocratic approach ensures that your contributions directly impact your opportunities and shares within the organization. Compete in Code4rena, Sherlock, CodeHawks, and HatsFinance, and watch your scores translate into meaningful opportunities and shares in the treasury.

### 2. **Transparent Compensation**

Fairness in compensation is a primary concern, and we address it head-on. The transparency in our compensation model means that every auditor receives their due share of rewards. Private Audit fees cover operational costs, while Public Audit rewards go directly to the auditorsâ€”your efforts are not only recognized but also fairly compensated.

### 3. **Collaborative Environment**

Cooperation is at the core of our security reviews. Working together not only ensures high-quality results but also provides a platform for continuous learning and improvement. Collaborate in every possible phase, follow the best audit model, and contribute to the collective achievements of the team in competitions, bug bounty programs, and CTF challenges.

### 4. **Ownership and Influence**

KupiaSec operates as a DAO-like organization, ensuring that every member has a stake and influence in the organization's direction. Ownership is not just a concept; it directly affects the future of the organization. Your individual score and contributions determine your share ownership, giving you a voice in the decisions that shape KupiaSec.

### 5. **Diverse Opportunities**

Being part of KupiaSec opens doors to a diverse range of opportunities. As an auditor, you may lead private audits, participate in exclusive opportunities on competition platforms, and contribute to the organization's reputation by taking on CTF challenges. Your skills and achievements pave the way for a dynamic and fulfilling audit journey.
