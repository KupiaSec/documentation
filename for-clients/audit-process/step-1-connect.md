Initiate your smart contract security journey by reaching out to KupiaSec.&#x20;

At KupiaSec, we believe in clarity and openness, especially when it comes to pricing.&#x20;

We apply a flat rate based on your codebase size measured by SLOC (Solidity Lines Of Code).

$$Days=\lceil SLOC/100 \rceil$$

$$Price=Days * \$2000$$ (USD)

For example, if the codebase has 1000 lines of Solidity code, the quote is calculated as 20000USD / 10 days.
