# Step 2: Audit Kickoff

Upon selecting KupiaSec as your smart contract security partner, engage in a kickoff call. This session is designed to establish clear communication channels, discuss project specifics, and set expectations for the audit process.

By default, Kupia will organize a MPA process with the lead auditor selected based on our internal process.&#x20;

Generally, each phase will be designed as below:

* Phase 1 - Solo Audit by a Lead Auditor
* Phase 2 - Internal Competition
* Phase 3 - Mitigation Review

The whole process is transparent.

We will set up a GitHub project board where all findings will be tracked in real-time and invite protocol team members for discussion.
