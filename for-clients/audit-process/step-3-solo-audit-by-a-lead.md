# Step 3: Solo Audit by a Lead

Embark on the first phase of our Multi-Phase Audit (MPA) model with a Solo Audit conducted by a dedicated Lead Auditor. This deep dive into your smart contract codebase lays the foundation for a comprehensive assessment.

The lead auditor is pivotal in the process and is highly incentivized by a fixed percentage of the total reward. The lead auditor is regarded as the most responsible party in the audit process and is involved in all phases.&#x20;

We ensure the lead auditor will be available for future requests from the same protocol.

The lead auditor is also responsible for sharing the line-by-line comments and walkthrough explanations of the findings with the community auditors. At the end of Phase 1, KupiaSec organizes a brainstorming call and the lead auditor will explain the system architecture and his findings.

The lead auditor is also involved across all phases and the dynamic structure of the reward pool and scoring system incentivizes the lead auditor to identify more vulnerabilities continuously.
