# Step 4: Competitive Audit

Some auditors within the KupiaSec team participate in an internal competition. This phase ensures a diverse perspective, with multiple auditors scrutinizing the code to uncover potential vulnerabilities.

The competitive audit has been proven to be very effective in identifying edge cases by having many eyes to review the codebase.

Participants are motivated by the competitive spirit and a dynamic reward structure.

If more vulnerabilities are identified in Phase 2, the dynamic reward is distributed over the community auditors.

Note that the lead auditor is still encouraged to add findings during this phase because of the dynamic reward structure but they are not eligible for rewards. The newly found issues are regarded as known issues from Phase 1.

At the end of the competition, an initial report detailing the findings from the Solo Audit and Competitive Audit phases is delivered.&#x20;
