# Step 5: Mitigation

The protocol team resolves all the reported findings and KupiaSec works collaboratively to ensure effective solutions are applied, enhancing the overall security of your smart contracts.

We recommend handling each finding as a separate PR (pull request) for easy review.

Note that the protocol team already has access to the finding dashboard from the beginning of Phase 1 and there is no need to wait until you get the full report.&#x20;

It is highly recommended to start mitigation as soon as possible so that the auditors can review the changes while they have a good understanding.
