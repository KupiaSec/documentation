# Why Kupia

Multi-Phase Audit Model

KupiaSec employs a Multi-Phase Audit (MPA) model for the Private Audits, which consists of:

1.  **Solo Audit by a Lead Auditor:**

    A dedicated lead auditor conducts an in-depth examination of your smart contract codebase. This initial phase is crucial in identifying potential vulnerabilities and establishing the foundation for the audit process.
2.  **Internal Competition among all Auditors:**

    Following the Solo Audit, all auditors within the KupiaSec team engage in an internal competition. This approach ensures a diverse perspective, with multiple auditors scrutinizing the code to uncover any overlooked issues.
3.  **Mitigation Review to Address Findings:**

    The final phase involves a comprehensive review of the implementation of mitigation strategies. This ensures that not only are vulnerabilities discovered, but effective solutions are applied, enhancing the overall security of your smart contracts.
